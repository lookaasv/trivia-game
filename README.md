This is a simple Trivia Game application built using Streamlit. The app fetches trivia questions from the OpenTDB API and allows users to test their knowledge in various categories, difficulties, and question types.

## Features

- Answer multiple-choice or true/false questions.
- Track your progress and score during the game.
- Responsive user interface built with Streamlit.
